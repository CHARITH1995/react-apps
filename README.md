# React Apps
A repository containing some great react apps, all open source :+1:

# How to get the project up and running?
1. Navigate into myapp folder
2. Open up a command line in that folder and run ```npm install```
3. This will install all the packages required by the react app.
4. Run ```npm start``` at the same command line. This will create a local development server on your machine.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 .
6. You will have your react app up and running :smile:
